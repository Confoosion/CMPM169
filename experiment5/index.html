				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>In this experiment, I wanted to make something that people might want to use if they were
				   to create a design for a shirt or hoodie. Making a cool design for a word/phrase/name can be automated
				   in this experiment and it was heavily inspired by stuff like graffiti and the designs you might
				   see on shirts and hoodies.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>The experiment basically makes a letter the moment it is typed, and when the cursor is hovered
				   over the original line of the letter, it adds a new line that gets expanded and slightly changes
				   its shape from the original letter lines. The way it changes color is simply just iterating through
				   a list of colors, and more colors can be added if the user wanted.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I worked alone on this, so I did everything. My original idea was very different from the finished
				   experiment, but I am still happy with the end result. Originally, I was taking inspiration from
				   puzzle designs, and how some hidden text can be represented like how iMessage has a hidden text feature.
				   However, overtime my ideas shifted more towards graffiti and to designs that skaters might have on
				   their shirts or hoodies, which I thought would be cool to create automatically.
