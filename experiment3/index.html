				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>In this experiment, I wanted the user experiences a unique sound that almost sounds
				   magical, as if the user were in a cavern full of crystals. The user is free to create
				   more balls to bounce around the screen and generate more sound. I think it's very
				   interesting to hear the unique melodies and sounds this experiment can generate because
				   it feels like something new can be heard every time.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>The moving tiles were made with a p5 rectangle, and it moves in a cosine pattern.
				   The ball checks for collision with those tiles, and whenever a collision happens, the
				   sound gets created. Once a ball bounces off of a tile 3 times, it disappears, so the
				   user is encouraged to create more balls by left clicking. The sound itself was pretty
				   cool to make because it uses an oscillator and an envelope, along with some reverb to
				   make it sound more like it's in a cave.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I worked alone on this, so I did everything. It was fun to mess around with sound in p5.js
				   because I didn't know any of this stuff existed, so I was messing around with what kinds of
				   sounds I could make. Starting with a few piano tiles was very helpful to get this experiment
				   moving forward. There were also a lot of difficulties throughout the experiment such as sound
				   not sounding nice enough, or the ball glitching into the line and causing the sound to crunch
				   and eventually crash the program. I'm pretty sure a bug still happens where too many balls will
				   crash the program, but I've only encountered it once... so far.
