				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>"R" to Restart/Rerun<br>
				   Left-click to place a Cell<br><br>
				   In this experiment, I was looking for a feel that was similar to an imagined
				   cellular system in the human body. When a cell touches another cell, it reacts
				   in 2 different ways: It either receives or gives its color to the other cell.
				   I think it's a pretty unique way to represent cells fighting each other to
				   see which one will come out dominant. Players can also effectively change the
				   outcome by placing cells into the field to see if one or more cells can overcome
				   the dominant cells.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>This code creates a simulation of "boids" where each boid behaves similarly to a
				   flock of birds, reacting to its neighbors with basic flocking behaviors: alignment,
				   cohesion, and separation. When aligning with another cell, there is a 25% chance that
				   the cell will receive that other cell's color. This is what creates the cool experience
				   of watching the cells "fight" and constantly change color until one cell's color
				   becomes the dominant color.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>As I was the only one who worked on this experiment, I thought it was really cool
				   to mess around with all kinds of generative methods without having to stick with
				   a specific one. Throughout the experiment, I was going through different kinds of
				   ways to represent generative methods and I was trying to look through a few examples,
				   but everytime I found a new example, I wanted to do the newest one instead of the
				   previous method. It was only until I found out and learned about what "boids" are that
				   I finally was able to stick with a method for the experiment.
