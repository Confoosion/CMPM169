				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>When I was working on this piece, I was looking through the Generative Design sketches and came across
				   <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/generative-design/sketches/P_2_0_01">this one</a>.
				   I thought it was a really good design since it reminded me of a spiral motion, but I wanted it to be automated
				   because I thought that using the mouse wasn't as fun as seeing it move on its own. That addition can be found
				   <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/jfsales/sketches/HXUMvBk-O">here</a>.
				   I loved the automated process of the animation because it felt like the animation was pulling me into some cool spiral black hole,
				   but it felt like something was still missing. The original was only black and white, so why not add color?
				   That's exactly what I did in the animation design above. The colors are randomly chosen for each specific line drawn. Which I think
				   adds a nice touch to the randomness of the piece as it pulsates back and forth. One thing I especially love about this
				   piece is that a smaller circle forms within the lines and it can look really trippy when all of the colors try to mix.
				</p>

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>I feel like I didn't have to do much technically. I essentially took the concept from the original sketch, but instead of making it
				   based on the player's mouse input, I made it so there was a set speed to go back and forth, and the code would check if the
				   simulated input was either at the edge of the background or in the center. This way, the player would not be relied on in order
				   to make something cool. For the colors, I simply just called a random value from 0 to 255 for each RGB value. Originally, the entire
				   piece would change color, but I thought that it was very boring. Eventually I changed it to make each specific line a random color
				   every time the canvas is drawn because it made the piece feel more alive and active.
				   You can see the code <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/jfsales/sketches/9Vp-7Lmf2">here</a>.

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I was the only one who had worked on this. It was a really fun experiment to work on, but I was worried I didn't have something unique
				   enough because I feel very rusty on my JavaScript skills and had to search up a lot of things on how to get the code working the way I
				   wanted it to. There was a time where the random colors just stopped working and I had no idea why because the documentation said to do
				   it the exact way I had it, and it didn't work. I was completely stumped, but suddenly it started working again without me touching it,
				   so I continued to never touch it again. In the end, it turned out just fine and I think it's actually a really cool thing to look at
				   and just gaze at it pulsing back and forth because the difference in the lines and the size of the lines can create unique moments within the animation.
